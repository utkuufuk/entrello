- Polls compatible services and keeps your Trello cards synchronized with fresh data.
- Listens for and filters each event from your Trello board and forwards it to the matching service.
- Can be run as a scheduled job, or an HTTP server:
    ```sh
    # cron job
    go run ./cmd/runner

    # HTTP server
    PORT=<port> USERNAME=<user> PASSWORD=<password> go run ./cmd/server

    # make a `POST`Â request to the HTTP server to trigger a poll
    curl -d @config.json <SERVER_URL> -H "Authorization: Basic <base64(<user>:<password>)>"
    ```

## Example Use Case
Let's say you have an HTTP service that returns GitHub issues that are assigned to you upon a `GET` request.
Then `entrello` can use it as a data source to keep your GitHub issues synchronized in your Trello board.

Moreover, if you use `entrello` as a server (not as a runner), you can make your GitHub service listen to updates to the events from the Trello board about its own cards and react to them.

For instance, when a Trello card representing a GitHub issue has been archived, your GitHub service could auto-close that issue on GitHub. 

## Services
Each service must
- return a JSON array of Trello card objects upon a `GET` request. See `pkg/trello/trello.go` for reference
- respond with a 200 status code upon a `POST` request containing information about Trello events on corresponding cards

## Configuration
Copy and rename `config.example.json` as `config.json` (default), then set your own values in `config.json`.

You can also use a custom config file path using the `-c` flag:
```sh
go run ./cmd/runner -c /path/to/config/file
```

### Trello
You need to set your [Trello API key & token](https://trello.com/app-key) in the configuraiton file, as well as the Trello board ID.

### Services
For each data service, the following parameters have to be specified. (See `config.example.json`)

- `name` &mdash; Service name.

- `endpoint` &mdash; Service endpoint. `entrello` will make a `GET` request to this endpoint to fetch fresh cards from the service.

- `strict` &mdash; When strict mode is enabled, previously auto-generated cards that are no longer present in the fresh data will be deleted. For instance, with a GitHub service, strict mode can be useful for automatically removing previously auto-generated cards for issues/PRs from the board when the corresponding issues/PRs are closed/merged.

- `label_id` &mdash; **Distinct** Trello label ID associated with the service.

- `list_id` &mdash; Trello list ID for the service to determine where to insert new cards. The selected list must be in the same board as configured by the `board_id` parameter.

- `period` &mdash; Polling period for the service. Some examples:
    ```json
    // query at 3rd, 6th, 9th, ... of each month
    "period": {
      "type": "day",
      "interval": 3
    }

    // query at 00:00, 02:00, 04:00, ... every day
    "period": {
      "type": "hour",
      "interval": 2
    }

    // query at XX:00, XX:15, XX:30 and XX:45 every hour
    "period": {
      "type": "minute",
      "interval": 15
    }

    // query on each execution
    "period": {
      "type": "default",
      "interval": 0
    }
    ```

## Example Cron Job
Assuming `config.json` is located in the current working directory:
``` sh
0 * * * * cd /home/you/git/entrello && /usr/local/go/bin/go run ./cmd/runner
```

Make sure that the cron job runs frequently enough to keep up with the most frequent custom interval in your configuration. For instance, it wouldn't make sense to define a custom period of 15 minutes while the cron job only runs every hour.

## Trello Webhooks
You can create a Trello webhook using the following command:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
https://api.trello.com/1/tokens/<api_token>/webhooks/ \
-d '{
  "key": "<api_key>",
  "callbackURL": "<url>",
  "idModel": "<id_model>",
  "description": "<desc>"
}'
```

* `api_token` &mdash; Trello API token
* `api_key` &mdash; Trello API key
* `url` &mdash; Entrello Server URL
* `id_model` &mdash; Trello Board ID
* `desc` &mdash; Arbitrary description string
